# CloudTag
CloudTag is a Curator ensemble provider which returns connection string based on cloud servers with matching tags.

The idea is simple, CloudTag lists all nodes in your cloud and, based on tag name and its value, filters nodes which
are ZooKeeper nodes and constructs a connection string.

The minimal configuration looks like this:

```
cloudtag.provider=aws-ec2
cloudtag.identity=ABCXXXXXXXXXXXXX
cloudtag.credential=DEFYYYYYYYYYYY
cloudtag.tagName=Name
cloudtag.tagValue=NAT01
```

# EnsembleProvider implementations

There are two Curator's `EnsembleProvider` implementations:

 * `CloudTagEnsembleProvider` - a call to `getConnectionString` method is synchronous
 * `AsynCloudTagEnsembleProvider` - uses `ScheduledExecutorService` under the hood to periodically generate
a connection string which then is returned by `getConnectionString` in a non-blocking way

# Examples

Please refer to `src/test/java` for examples.

CloudTag was tested using jcloud's `aws-ec2` and `rackspace-cloudservers-uk`/`rackspace-cloudservers-us` providers.
